        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>   2 tablespoons butter </li>
                <li>  ½ large sweet red onion, thinly sliced  </li>
                <li>  1 tablespoon maple syrup  </li>
                <li>   2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained </li>
                <li>  2 tablespoons creamy salad dressing (such as Miracle Whip®)  </li>
                <li>  salt and ground black pepper to taste  </li>
                <li>    1 (12 ounce) loaf Italian olive bread</li>
                <li>  8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese  </li> 
            </ul>
        <h3> Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Heat butter in a small frying pan over medium heat, and cook and stir onion for 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, stir in maple syrup, and cook until onions are soft and golden, 7 to 10 minutes.   </li>
                <li> Set oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
                </li>
                <li>  Stir together tuna and salad dressing in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Slice bread loaf in half horizontally, then halve both pieces lengthwise, making four equal pieces. Place bread, crust-side down, on a baking sheet. Layer tuna mixture, onion, and Cheddar cheese evenly over bread pieces.
                </li>
                <li> Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly, about 5 minutes.   </li>
            </ol>
